# Gold-Price-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Analysis 

## Objective:
"This project aims to predict the future prices of gold using historical data and machine learning techniques."

## Dataset:
"The dataset is sourced from  Kaggle."

## Tech Stack:
"This project is developed using Python, with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization."

## Approach:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and handled missing data, normalized features, Transformation etc.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends and correlations between gold prices and external factors.
- Model Selection: Compared multiple machine learning models like ARIMA, Auto-ARIMA

## Evaluation: 
- Typically, we will use three accuracy metrices:-
- MAPE, Correlation and Min-Max Error
- The above three are percentage errors that vary between 0 and 1. That way, we can judge how good is the forecast irrespective of the scale of the series

## Insights:

- MAPE of 7.32% is quite low, suggesting that the model's predictions are fairly accurate in terms of percentage error. A lower MAPE indicates better forecast accuracy.
- Min-Max Accuracy: 7.22 indicates good performance in tracking the actual values' range. A lower value indicates that the forecasted values are relatively close to the actual values across their range
